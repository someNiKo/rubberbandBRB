>This paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) that integrates a compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing-abdomen motion. Drawing inspiration from the natural flight dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experiments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.
